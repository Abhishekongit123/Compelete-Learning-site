	Web Application Framework or simply “web framework” is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Frameworks are, in short, libraries that help you develop your application faster and smarter!<br>
    Nowadays, the number of Web Frameworks has increased greatly. To help you pick up the most suitable one for your Web Application, we have compiled a list of 10 best frameworks available online, in your preferred language.<br>
    <strong>A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF)</strong> is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse.[1] Although they often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites.

	<strong class="my-1" style="font-size: 30px;color: black;font-family: 'Grenze Gotisch', cursive;">Types of Web frameworks(WF)</strong><br>
	We have two functions of frameworks – a) the one to work on the server side, that helps to set up app logic on the server (backend) or b) to work on the client-side (front end).<br>
	<strong style="font-size: 20px;color: black;font-family: 'Grenze Gotisch', cursive;"><u>(A) Server-side Frameworks/Back-end Frameworks</u></strong><br>
	Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc. These frameworks can improve security and form the output data- simplifying the development process. Some of the top server-side frameworks are –
	<ul class="my-2">
	<li>NET (C#)</li>
	<li>Django (Python)</li>
	<li>Ruby on Rails (Ruby)</li>
	<li>Express (JavaScript/Node.JS)</li>
	<li>Symfony (PHP)</li>
	</ul>
	<strong style="font-size: 20px;color: black;font-family: 'Grenze Gotisch', cursive;"><u>(B) Client-side Frameworks/Front-end Framework</u></strong><br>
	Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces. A number of animated features can be created with frontend and single page applications.<br>
	<strong class="my-1" style="font-size: 30px;color: black;font-family: 'Grenze Gotisch', cursive;">What are the Advantages of using a web framework for development?</strong><br>
	<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
		<li><label style="font-size: 20px;color: black;font-family: 'Grenze Gotisch', cursive;"><u>Security:</u></label><br>
		As far as a framework usually developed and tested by many different developers it can gain a strong level of <strong>security</strong>.
	    </li>
	</ol>
	<strong style="font-size: 20px;color: black;font-family: 'Grenze Gotisch', cursive;"><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br>
    A web framework is not be-all and end-all when it comes to developing a web app. Even so, a web application framework simplifies and speeds-up the development process significantly, helping you create a highly responsive and engaging web app.
