	<p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="font-family: 'Lateef', cursive;">A JavaScript framework is an application framework written in JavaScript. It differs from a JavaScript library in its control flow: A library offers functions to be called by its parent code, whereas a framework defines the entire application design.<br>	
    On the other hand, a JS framework has more control of your app. It helps direct you on the architecture and the project that follows. Frameworks consist of multiple libraries and they provide you with hooks and callbacks, so you can continue to build upon them.<br>
    JavaScript frameworks and libraries are both useful and it’s a good idea to experiment and see which ones work best for you.

    <label class="font-weight-bold" style="font-size: 25px;">What Are JavaScript Libraries?</label><br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Lateef', cursive; font-size: 20px;">Generally, a JS library is a reusable piece of code that oftentimes has one primary use case. A library can consist of several functions/objects/methods, depending on the language. Your application can “link” to a library to allow you access to that functionality.<br>
    	<strong>List of Javascript libraries given bellow:</strong>

    <label class="font-weight-bold" style="font-size: 25px;">What Are JavaScript Framework?</label><br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Lateef', cursive; font-size: 20px;">Put simply, a JavaScript framework is a tool that you can leverage to develop advanced web applications, especially SPAs.<br>

    Back in the day, web developers would implement front end logic by relying heavily on vanilla JS and jQuery. But, as front end applications became more and more complex, the tools rose to meet that complexity.<br>
    <p class="font-weight-bold text-danger">At their most basic, JS frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries (see below) that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications around.</p><br>
        <strong>List of Javascript Framework given below:</strong>
        <ul style="list-style: circle; list-style: outside;">
        	<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="text-decoration-none font-weight-bold text-danger">Node.js</a>-Node.js is a server-side JavaScript run-time environment, which works on cross platforms and is open-source. The framework is capable of driving asynchronous I/O with its event-driven architecture. It works in the JavaScript Runtime environment and hence shows similar properties of JAVA like threading, packages, forming of loops.

        		<div class="container-sm p-2 border bg-white m-2" id="boxnjs" style="display: none;">
        			<ol style="list-style: circle;">
        				<li class="font-weight-bold text-warning" style="list-style: none;">Features:</li>
        				<li>I/O is asynchronous and Event-Driven</li>
        				<li>Single-threaded</li>
        				<li>Highly scalable</li>
        				<li>Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.</li>
        			</ol>
        		</div>
        	</li>
        	<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/" class="text-decoration-none font-weight-bold text-danger">AngularJS</a>-One of the most powerful, efficient, and open-source JavaScript frameworks is Angular. Google operates this framework and is implemented to use for developing a Single Page Application (SPA). It extends the HTML into the application and interprets the attributes to perform data binding.
        		<input type="button" value="Features Of AngularJS" id="ajs" class="btn btn-secondary font-weight-bold">
        		<div class="container-sm p-2 border bg-white m-2" id="boxajs" style="display: none;">
        			<ol style="list-style: circle;">
        				<li class="font-weight-bold text-warning" style="list-style: none;">Features:</li>
        				<li><strong class="font-weight-bold">Writing less code –</strong> When carrying out DOM manipulation a lot of JavaScript was required to be written to design any application. But with Angular, you will be amazed with the lesser amount of code you need to write for DOM manipulation.</li>
        				<li><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Unit Testing ready –</strong> The designers at Google not only developed Angular but also developed a testing framework called "Karma" which helps in designing unit tests for AngularJS applications.</li>
        				<li><strong class="font-weight-bold">MVC -</strong>AngularJS is an open source Model-View-Controller framework which is similar to the JavaScript framework.</li>
        			</ol>
        		</div>
        	</li>
        	<li><a href="https://www.emberjs.com/" class="text-decoration-none font-weight-bold text-danger">Ember.js</a>-Introduction of Ember.js to the software market in was 2015, and since then, it has gained popularity with its wide application area. The features of Ember.js support two-way data binding and hence, establish a reliable platform for handling the complicated User Interfaces. Popular websites like LinkedIn, Netflix, Nordstrom, and many more use the Ember.JS platform for their websites.<br>
        	<strong class="font-weight-bold text-success">The original name of Ember.js was SproutCore MVC framework. It was developed by Yehuda Katz and initially released on in December 2011. The stable release of Ember.js is 2.10.0 and this was released on November 28, 2016.</strong>

        				<li>Ember. js is used for creating reusable and maintainable JavaScript web applications.</li>
        				<li>Ember. js has HTML and CSS at the core of the development model.</li>
        				<li>Ember.js provides Ember Inspector tool for debugging Ember applications.</li>

        	</li>
        	<li><a href="http://d3js.org/" class="text-decoration-none font-weight-bold text-danger">Vue.js</a>-Though developed in the year 2016, this JavaScript framework has already made its way into the market and has proven its worth by offering various features. Its dual integration mode is one of the most attractive features for the creation of high-end SPA or Single Page Application. It is a much reliable platform for developing cross-platform.

        				<li><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Animation/Transition -</strong>VueJS provides various ways to apply transition to HTML elements when they are added/updated or removed from the DOM. VueJS has a built-in transition component that needs to be wrapped around the element for transition effect. We can easily add third party animation libraries and also add more interactivity to the interface.</li>
        				<li>VueJS script is very <strong class="font-weight-bold">lightweight</strong> and the performance is also very fast.</li>
